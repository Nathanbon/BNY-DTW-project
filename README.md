Project done during my master 1 year in partnership with the eFX desk of the Bank of New York Mellon. This is work to carry out an algorithmic trading strategy in Python based on the exploration of time series (DTW coupled with Mean Reverting) on ​​FX products (mainly EURUSD vs GBPUSD).

- A code file
- A report explaining our attempts, our research, the progress of our code and the different graphs produced.
